# Engines

Each engine has a specific folder with a Dockerfile and README which specifies
how to build the Docker image and execute mappings with it.

Several folders are available for executing mappings:

- `/data`: all input data for the mapping rules.
- `/mappings`: mapping rules to execute.
- `/results`: for benchmarks, results can be stored here.
- `/configs`: if applicable, the engine configuration file(s).
